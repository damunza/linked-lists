# linked-lists

linked-list is a project that illustrates the creation and interaction with linked lists in python

## Description

Linked lists are a python data type i found to be more linient on memory.They are made up of nodes that point to each other with ie. 
![example of a node](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/17168/1456961238-28488bfa0d-LinkedListExplanation.png)

By creating the pointers to the next data in the linked list, list items are able to refer to occupy different sections in memory with the first in last out. I found this to be very convenient.

## How this program works

create an instance of your linked list:
> insatnce = linkedList()

to create a new node eg 5 -> :
> Node(5)

to add nodes to a linked list:
> _your list instance_.addNode(_your node_)

to find the position of your node:
> _your linked list_.idofNode(_your node value_)

to delete a node by its id:
> _your linked list_.removebyId(_your node id_)
